karpathy: A report on the geopolitics of AI by @timhwang, especially found Part 3 interesting https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08971 , and the highly related "U.S. Semiconductor Manufacturing: Industry Trends, Global Competition, Federal Policy" https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44544.pdf …

karpathy: Growing as a programmer is to a large extent the accumulation of scars in your mind, which burn with each new line of code proportional to the expected pain inflicted on your future self over all possible refactoring.

karpathy: “The state of the art in explanation of a concept” - a phrase I first heard in a chat with @3blue1brown a while ago but has lingered with me since. Why shouldn’t there be an effort to seek/recognize such a thing for all concepts

karpathy: 2023+: only those with access to powerful AGIs can now register for the NIPS conference.

karpathy: plan:
2019: be ready & fully caffeinated the millisecond it goes up
2020: write some JS to register me instantly
2021: discover the physical location of the NIPS backend & plug in via fibre optic next door
2022: orchestrate a DDOS attack of requests for my registration
2023: ???

karpathy: My morning coffee turned out to be the difference between going and not going to NIPS 2018 this year. Apparently sold out in <15 minutes. I laughed at this diagram a year ago, but today it is too real.https://twitter.com/soumithchintala/status/909057642731130880 …

karpathy: Available video speeds on YouTube: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0. What monster left out the 1.75x

karpathy: “A Magazine Is an iPad That Does Not Work” https://youtu.be/aXV-yaFmQNk  a fave video. As our technosphere becomes more advanced & pervasive it is increasingly difficult to distinguish it from raw physics. Eg one day it will be odd that there was a time you couldn’t talk to all objects

karpathy: Full Body Surrogacy for Collaborative Communication https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrc7gH6dydw … interesting

PyTorch: We're excited to host the first PyTorch Developer Conference, featuring talks, discussions and posters from the core-devs, academia and industry. 
Date: Oct 2nd, 2018 in San Francisco.

Space is limited, apply for an invite at https://pytorch.fbreg.com 

karpathy: "Hybrid Optical-Electronic Convolutional Neural Networks" http://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/hybrid-optical-electronic-convolutional-neural-networks/ … incredibly interesting work - develops a hybrid optoelectronic CNN with an optical CONV1 layer that operates at zero power consumption (with rest of the forward pass in electronics (for now))

karpathy: There was an interestingly prophetic short story that has left a lasting impression on me and now can’t find. It’s few decades old and describes a highly accelerated future with people going through multiple jobs, partners, and rich and bankrupt cycles each day. Rings any bells?

jhnhw: First 1e6 integers, represented as binary vectors indicating their prime factors, and laid out using the sparse matrix support in @leland_mcinnes's UMAP dimensionality reduction algorithm. This is from a 1000000x78628 (!) binary matrix. Very pretty structure emerges.pic.twitter.com/PF6slS2EO3

karpathy: Great post exploring the details of one of the first few programs.https://twobithistory.org/2018/08/18/ada-lovelace-note-g.html …

karpathy: was trying to compile the list based on courses at schools and which books they use to make this a bit more data driven, but gave up 2 hours into it. Very difficult information to find, absence of any schema.

karpathy: Discovering (paradoxically late in life) that I get more out of textbooks than books and that I don’t have to stop buying them just because I’m out of school. Good reading list pointers:https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject …

karpathy: "An Empirical Evaluation of Generic Convolutional and Recurrent Networks for Sequence Modeling" https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01271  good to see more papers on the topic - always start with a CNN before reaching for an RNN. You'll be surprised with how far you can get.

karpathy: The latest entry in turning ImageNet into MNIST: 75.8% top-1 test accuracy with ResNet-50 (90 epochs) in 6.6 minutes using 2048 Tesla P40 GPUs https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11205  64K "mini"-batch size, mixed precision training, LARS, BN&bias weight decay at zero, custom all-reduce

NathanBenaich: #AI newsletter, State of AI 2018 edition, coming out tomorrow. Drop your deets here to get it straight to your http://www.nathan.ai 

karpathy: That deeply soul crushing feeling when you're super excited to try out this new thing you just impulse bought only to discover that batteries are not included. To add insult to injury sometimes manufacturers go the extra mile and require you to also remove screws to install them.

ericjang11: "There are exactly four normed division algebras: the real numbers (R), complex numbers (C), quaternions (H), and octonions (O). " I really love when @QuantaMagazine goes in depth on more obscure and under-appreciated fields.

karpathy: The quest for optimal normalization in neural nets continues. SwitchNorm: add BatchNorm + InstanceNorm + GroupNorm with a learnable blend at each layer https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10779  fun plots; + codehttps://github.com/switchablenorms/Switchable-Normalization …

goodfellow_ian: This new family of GAN loss functions looks promising! I'm especially excited about Fig 4-6, where we see that the new loss results in much faster learning during the first several iterations of training. I implemented the RSGAN loss on a toy problem and it worked well.https://twitter.com/jm_alexia/status/1014101054156431360 …

jaschasd: Adversarial Reprogramming of Neural Networks https://goo.gl/qnB5FA  A new goal for adversarial attacks!

karpathy: 6) thinking view() and permute() are the same thing (& incorrectly using view)

ericjang11: New blog post in which I share my thoughts on the ICRA conference & state of robotics research! https://blog.evjang.com/2018/06/icra2018.html …

karpathy: oh: 5) you didn't use bias=False for your Linear/Conv2d layer when using BatchNorm, or conversely forget to include it for the output layer .This one won't make you silently fail, but they are spurious parameters

karpathy: most common neural net mistakes: 1) you didn't try to overfit a single batch first. 2) you forgot to toggle train/eval mode for the net. 3) you forgot to .zero_grad() (in pytorch) before .backward(). 4) you passed softmaxed outputs to a loss that expects raw logits. ; others? :)

karpathy: e.g. RL DNN trained on CSGO would likely relatively quickly but somewhat unimpressively become a superhuman aimbot

karpathy: would be interesting to see a strategy game (e.g. Starcraft/DOTA) match mode with focus on strategy & taking out agility. E.g. slow down game 20x so battles can be easily micro'd on human time scales (?). related discussion inhttp://www.gamesbyangelina.org/2018/06/good-luck-have-fun/ …

karpathy: Fun project request following up on last tweet: visually render in 3D code bases (git repos) to look like construction / factory. Modules become sites, topology follows function calls, compute becomes movement, developers swarm around in yellow hats building it...

RobJHeaton: I've been working on a system to remember more of what I read. It’s obviously not the result of years of (or indeed any) scientific verification, but I have found it to be quite effective.https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/25/how-to-read/ …

karpathy: Spent some time at the factory last night. Felt like Alice in Wonderland, except with Wonderland as the home planet of the Transformers. I love software, but editing text files at a computer is nowhere near as viscerally overwhelming.
