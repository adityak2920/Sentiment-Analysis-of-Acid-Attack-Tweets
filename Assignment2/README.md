India has made international headlines for horrific rape cases in recent years, but acid attacks are common, too, although they receive less attention.Acid attack is the worst of the crimes that take place not only in India, but in the world. Concentrated hydrochloric acid is used as a weapon in this act of violence. During my research on this I came across an article describing the story of an acid attack survivor which was really shattering and shocking for me and here comes the story:
		
    Shabana Khatun, 21, from the eastern Indian city of Kolkata, was in love with a boy and wanted to marry
    him. She had known him for four years, and one Saturday evening in June last year, she was invited to 
    meet his family and seek permission for their marriage.
		Soon after Shabana arrived at her boyfriend's house, his family started assaulting her.
		In the course of her long ordeal, she was force-fed one bottle of acid, resulting in severe internal 
    injuries.Since then she has been unable to eat anything solid, and survives on a liquid diet. Her 
    assailants, meanwhile, remain free, and are not yet facing criminal charges.
    "One of them pinned me down while another held my hands and legs. The father of my boyfriend then forced
    acid down my throat," she says, shuddering while recounting her ordeal.
    As she slipped into unconsciousness, her assailants grew bolder. They stripped off her clothes and had the 
    remaining acid thrown at her private body parts. While she was conscious, her boyfriend silently watched.

There are 250 to 300 acid attacks reported in India every year, despite laws restricting the sale of acid or other deadly chemicals,Â according to Stop Acid Attacks, a non-profit group. With acids - something as ubiquitous as toilet-cleaning liquids readily available at the corner store and as cheap as 30 cents a litre, these assaults have emerged as a preferred weapon of violence against women.
According to the law 326A, against acid attacks the law states: 
"Whoever causes permanent or partial damage or deformity to, or burns or maims or disfigures or disables, any part or parts of the body of a person or causes grievous hurt by throwing acid on or by administering acid to that person, or by using any other means with the intention of causing or with the knowledge that he is likely to cause such injury or hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and with fine"
The law only recognizes those victims who have been blinded and deformed by the acid attacks. Many victims have other kind of disfigurement. Nothing is classified separately in the new law. Conviction rates are very low in India, and so it does not act as a deterrent. The attackers also get bail easily.

#### As I mentioned above all the reasons which really pushed me choose this task instead of the other two.
