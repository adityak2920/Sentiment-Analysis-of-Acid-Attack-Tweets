According to Stop Acid Attacks, a non-profit group , there are 250 to 300 acid attacks reported in India every year, despite
laws restricting the sale of acid or other deadly chemicals. Acid attack is the worst of the crimes that take place not only
in India, but in the world and in attacks social media play a very crucial role. In this paper we will mainly focus on
microblogging website, Twitter. This paper focuses on collection, analysis, and performing sentiment analysis on tweets.
The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:
  1.The labeled dataset for learning patterns in tweets exhibiting acid attack threats ideation which is manually labeled.
  2.Applying LSTM for feature attraction from dataset which is related with acid attack threats
  3.Efforts to prevent acid attack

Regarding efforts to prevent such crimes like rape threats, acid attack threats and threats in general,using this paper an
automated system for scrapping and identifying threat tweets in real time can be developed and user id which is concerned with
threat tweet can be reported to twitter and police to take a eye on that person. So, if something is going to happen bad,
police can identify that person and can take strict action. Above all that the most important thing is moral values so we
should focus more on this.
