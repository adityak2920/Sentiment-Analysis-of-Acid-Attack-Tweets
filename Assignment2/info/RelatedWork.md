Acid attack is a horrific crime but it didnâ€™t get much attention like rape cases .There are NGOs and different organisations who works for acid attack victims but these organisation comes into play after the crime so there is not much work going on how can we stop or at least reduce acid attack.
And in these crimes social media platforms like Facebook and twitter play a crucial role from stalking a girl to commenting threat comments all these things happen on social media, here we will only focus on microblogging website Twitter. To date little research has been published about recognizing acid attack threat on twitter and how can we trace stalker through social platforms.
Efforts are being made to analyse rape threat comments and other kinds of threats using tweets and perform sentiment analysis.
Like, a paper on the early detection of threats in the real world based on open-source information on the internet ([Bouma Henri](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dcc/7bb08e46f3d4ffe7025b76f55d1a702f1a94.pdf)) in this paper a novel method to automatically monitor trends and detect abnormal behavior on Twitter or other social media. Specifically, it proposes a profiling system based on the analysis of a number of features, such as activity, sentiment, threat, demonstration, and grammatical tense.
A paper from 2014 IEEE JISIC, which presented a ethod for detecting threatening messages on Twitter based on trigger keywords and contextual cues and there results showed that the model can successfully analyze messages and recognize threatening content([Pieter T. Eendebak](http://pietereendebak.nl/files/Spitters_2014_ThreatDetection.pdf)). 
There are various research papers on sentiment analysis of twitter data for threats, suicidal ideation in tweets([Ramit Sawhney](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-3013)).For sentiment analysis there are various approach on of them is adding semantics as additional features into the training set for sentiment analysis ([Yulan He](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-35176-1_32.pdf)).One of the very first papers on sentiment analysis of twitter data using SVMs, Naive Bayes([Alec Go](http://www.yuefly.com/Public/Files/2017-03-07/58beb0822faef.pdf)).Apaper which deals with survey and a comparative analyses of existing techniques for opinion mining like machine learning and lexicon-based approaches, together with evaluation metrics([Vishal A. Kharde](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06971.pdf)). 
                                         
But none of these and other papers which are not mentioned here focused on Acid Attack threat ideation tweets.So, there are much needed work, we can analyse tweets and comments which is related to acid attack threats. After that, we can apply sentiment analysis on theses tweets and make a LSTM model which will be helpful in analysing other tweets whether it's a threat or a news or some other type.
