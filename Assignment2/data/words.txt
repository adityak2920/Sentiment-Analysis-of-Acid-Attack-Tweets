In the age of social media, it’s not very to difficult to collect data related to acid attack threat because an increasing
number of people are turning to the Internet to vent their frustration.Anonymised data was collected from microblogging
website Twitter - specifically, content containing acid attack threats related to india over the period of October 2018 to
December 2008. The total no.of tweets collected for this purpose are around 28000. After that in preprocessing we tried to
remove retweets as many to maintain certain no. of tweets and at last got approximately 7000 tweets. The tweets are collected
which have following words or phrases:
‘acid threat’,’acid attack threat’, ‘acidattack’, ‘acid attack india’, ‘punish acid', india’, ‘should acid india’, ‘kill acid
india’ ,’acid throw india’.  The tweets were collected without knowing the sentiments like whether
1. It’s a threat like ‘I will pour acid on you’ or ‘we should throw acid’
2. It’s reporting of some acid attack news like ‘Acid attack on 3 girls in MP’.
3. It can be something like this also ‘acid should be banned in india to stop acid attack’
For choosing words and phrases for scraping we used tfidf method for frequency of that word.For Example-
TF-IDF for a set of similar tweets for the keyword ‘kill acid india’.Code for this using sklearn given below:
Code:           
            from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
            vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
            response = vectorizer.fit_transform(tweets1)
            print(vectorizer.vocabulary_)
Output:
      {'death': 9, 'penalty': 29, 'week': 46, 'dare': 8, 'kill': 22, 'someone': 37, 'real': 35, 'fact': 15, 'values': 43,
'humans': 20, 'india': 21, 'made': 25, 'political': 32, 'leaders': 24, 'worse': 49, 'thn': 41, 'animals': 2, 'free': 17,
'attacks': 3, 'bribe': 4, 'ok': 28, 'knw': 23, 'power': 33, 'gandis': 18, 'christian': 6, 'world': 48, 'slowly': 36,
'surely':38, 'modi': 26, 'taking': 39, 'action': 1, 'think': 40, 'forgets': 16, 'wht': 47, 'promised': 34, 'never': 27,
'wait': 44, 'watch': 45, 'people': 30, 'huge': 19, 'corruption': 7, 'dimak': 11, 'eaten': 12, 'evn': 14, 'acid': 0, 'cant':
5, 'tht': 42, 'entered': 13, 'department': 10, 'pity': 31}

The word with the low tfidf means it’s not unique it appears in every tweets means we can scrape using this word. 
In Code for tfidf, response gives term document matrix. So, from response tfidf for kill and india are 0.1139 in a tweet which
is lowest in that tweet. Means we can consider them for scrapping.

For data annotation:
1. Acid Attack Threat present : 1
            1. tweets in which user is giving threat to another user like 'I will throw acid on you' or 'i will kill with acid' 
            2. tweets like 'we should throw acid on acid attackers' also considered as threat
            
2.  Acid Attack Threat absent : 0
            1. news reportings like 'Acid attack on 3 women in MP'
            2. like 'acid attack survivors should be given reservation'
